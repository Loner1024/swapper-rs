# swapper-rs

🚀 **swapper-rs** is a high-performance face-swapping application built with Rust!

## 🌟 Introduction

`swapper-rs` leverages Rust's performance and safety features to achieve fast and stable face-swapping functionality. This project is ideal for applications involving image processing and computer vision, such as special effects, deep learning research, and more.

🚧 **Early Development Stage** 🚧

This project is still in its early stages, and many features are not yet implemented. It is not recommended for non-developers at this time.

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized with Rust for fast face-swapping operations.
- 🔒 **Memory Safety**: Avoids common memory management issues found in C/C++.
- 🖼️ **Cross-Platform**: Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- 🧠 **Advanced AI**: Utilizes ONNX Runtime (ORT) for efficient deep learning inference.
- 🏗 **Smart Recognition**: Integrates advanced face detection and feature matching technology.

## 📦 Installation

At this time, `swapper-rs` does **not** support installation via `cargo install`.

To build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swapper-rs.git
cd swapper-rs
cargo build --release
```

## 🚀 Usage

```sh
./swapper-rs --input face1.jpg --swap face2.jpg --output result.jpg
```

Example:

```sh
./swapper-rs -i person1.jpg -s person2.jpg -o swapped.jpg
```
